# SteelEye_API_Developer_Assessment
Building a REST API with endpoints serving Trade data from a mocked database.

The Trade Data API solution presented here provides the necessary endpoints to retrieve a list of trades, fetch a single trade by ID, search for trades based on specific fields, and filter trades based on search criteria.
The FastAPI framework, along with the mocked database layer, offers a performance and scalable solution for building the API. Although the database layer is mocked, the API design can be easily extended to integrate with Elasticsearch or any other storage technology in a real-world scenario.
