# Steeleye API Developer ASSESSMENT

The Trade Data API is a REST API that serves trade data from a mocked database. It includes endpoints for retrieving a list of trades, fetching a single trade by ID, searching for trades based on specific fields, and filtering trades using custom search criteria.

The API is built using the FastAPI framework, which ensures high performance and scalability. The mocked database layer provides a simulated data source for development and testing purposes. However, the API design is flexible and can be extended to integrate with real-world storage technologies like Elasticsearch or other databases.

* Tools and Functions Used:
1. FastAPI: Used to develop the API, providing high performance and ease of use.
2. Endpoints: Functions to handle specific API requests like retrieving trade lists, fetching trades by ID, and executing custom searches.
3. Mocked Database: Simulated data source used during development and testing stages.
4. Potential for Integration: The API design allows easy integration with other storage technologies, such as Elasticsearch, for real-world scenarios.
